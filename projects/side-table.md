## materials
(1) 1/4-in x 2-ft x 4-ft Birch plywood
(2) 3/4-in x 2-ft x 4-ft (Red) Oak plywood
(100) #6 1-in interior wood screws

## first cuts
ripped the top/bottom sheets to width
for the first time I trimmed the edges to get a clean cut, not using the factory edge
cut on the line, so the result is 1/2 kerf less than measured
not ideal but will keep doing this for the rest of the pieces for consistency
